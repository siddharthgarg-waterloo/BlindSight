# BlindSight

## Inspiration

There are a lot of things we do in our lives that rely on our eyes, especially as programmers.

It came as a surprise to see a blind student in our classes. As much as companies and schools try to help people with disabilities, they have limited staff and resources.

When we learned about the City of Mississauga's Smart Cities initiative at PC Hacks, we thought of a way to make the project be more accessible and inclusive.

## What it does

We have developed an assistive technology application to help the visually impaired through live remote assistance from their mobile device called _BlindSight_.

Volunteers can _help the visually impaired enhance their daily lifestyle_ by allowing them to be more independent. Routine tasks like reading medicine bottle labels, navigating commute to and from work are more difficult to accomplish with limited vision.

**Core Features** - object recognition, live video chat, gesture navigation, remote assistance

## How we built it

**Swift 4** - iOS app

**Core ML** - object recognition

**Twilio** - video interface

**Firebase** - push notifications, server, database

**Balsamiq** - Wireframing for UI/UX

## Challenges we ran into

**Machine Learning** - Accuracy of objects recognized in the camera's view

**Server Connection** - Firebase

## What we learned

**UI/UX Design** - keeping UI simple to make a blind person's UX as smooth as possible (limiting buttons in case of errors - as the usual best practices don't apply to people with disabilities; privacy (disabling front-facing camera)

## What's next for BlindSight

**Android App** - to increase user base

**Reward System** - Partnering with sponsors to provide rewards for reaching helper milestones (number of hours, number of users helped, maintaining a high rating), and schools for community volunteering recognition

**Location Pairing** - Partnering with sponsors to provide rewards for reaching helper milestones (number of hours, number of users helped, maintaining a high rating), and schools for community volunteering recognition

**Voice Commands** - User-friendly navigation app

**Location Pairing** - Allowing volunteer to select specific user to help from a map
